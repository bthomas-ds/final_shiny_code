## mc_bigrams_trigrams.R - this code uses the quanteda, parallel, Matrix, tidyr, doParallel, and foreach modules. This code was executed on a laptop running a VMWare Linux instance with 21 gbs and a quad core. Using the Linux utility, htop, I discovered that 3 of my 4 cores were being used less than 3% of time. The recommendations for core configuration from StackOverFlow indicated that the parallel module should be configured with 1 less than the total number of cores. One core was reserved for the operating system. I used 3 cores and then divided the work into 3 partitions by using mcLappy. 3 separate outputs were joined and then aggregated. Quanteda was selected as the texting mining module after comparing it to others. Quanteda was the only module that had no issues creating bigrams without seeming to be locked in a loop at 50%. Quanteda finished in relativity quick time. Trigrams did not run successfully at 50% or 40% so 30% was the volume.
